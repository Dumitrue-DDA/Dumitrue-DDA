## Dumitru Andrei Despina
<p>
  I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in web development and a long-standing passion for IT. My interest in computers and technology started since I was little and that has driven me to pursue a career in computer science for the last seven years, since the beginning of high school.<br>
  Looking for a challenging internship or short term employment where I can contribute my experience whilst further deepening my knowledge of cyber security and IT as a whole.
